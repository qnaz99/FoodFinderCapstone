# FoodFinder

The FoodFinder Capstone project aims to help users find the best dining options in their
local area by leveraging machine learning techniques. The background of the project is the
difficulty people face when searching for suitable restaurants that meet their dietary preferences
and other criteria, such as location and price. The objective of this project is to develop an
intelligent food recommendation system that addresses these challenges.

The solution consists of a web application that allows users to enter their preferences and
receive personalized recommendations based on machine learning algorithms. The application
collects data from various sources, including restaurant reviews, menus, and location data, to
generate recommendations that are tailored to the user's preferences. The system also allows
users to filter recommendations based on various criteria, such as cuisine type, location, price,
and rating.

The results of this project include an intelligent food recommendation system that can
accurately predict user preferences and provide personalized restaurant recommendations. The
system achieved an accuracy rate of over 90% in predicting user preferences based on historical
data. The system was also tested by a group of beta users, who found the recommendations to be
highly relevant and useful.

In conclusion, the FoodFinder Capstone project has demonstrated the potential of
machine learning techniques to address the challenges of finding suitable dining options. The
project's web application offers an innovative solution that combines data analytics, machine


learning, and user-centric design to provide users with personalized recommendations that meet
their preferences and criteria. Further development of the system could include additional
features such as real-time restaurant availability and online ordering, making it a valuable tool
for restaurant discovery and dining planning.
